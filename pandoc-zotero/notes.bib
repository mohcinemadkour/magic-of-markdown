During the last decade, many systems biological approaches that base on genome-wide data have been developed to unravel the complexity of gene regulation. This review deals with the reconstruction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from experimental data through computational methods. Standard GRN inference methods primarily use gene expression data derived from microarrays. However, the incorporation of additional information from heterogeneous data sources, e.g. genome sequence and protein\textendash{}DNA interaction data, clearly supports the network inference process. This review focuses on promising modelling approaches that use such diverse types of molecular biological information. In particular, approaches are discussed that enable the modelling of the dynamics of gene regulatory systems. The review provides an overview of common modelling schemes and learning algorithms and outlines current challenges in GRN modelling.},

  abstract = {Author SummaryCellular systems comprise many diverse components and component interactions spanning signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and metabolism. Although signaling, metabolic, and regulatory activities are often investigated independently of one another, there is growing evidence that considerable interplay occurs among them, and that the malfunctioning of this interplay is associated with disease. The computational analysis of integrated networks has been challenging because of the varying time scales involved as well as the sheer magnitude of such systems (e.g., the numbers of rate constants involved). To this end, we developed a novel computational framework called integrated dynamic flux balance analysis (idFBA) that generates quantitative, dynamic predictions of species concentrations spanning signaling, regulatory, and metabolic processes. idFBA extends an existing approach called flux balance analysis (FBA) in that it couples ``fast'' and ``slow'' reactions, thereby facilitating the study of whole-cell phenotypes and not just sub-cellular network properties. We applied this framework to a prototypic integrated system derived from literature as well as a representative integrated yeast module (the high-osmolarity glycerol [HOG] pathway) and generated time-course predictions that matched with available experimental data. By extending this framework to larger-scale systems, phenotypic profiles of whole-cell systems could be attained expeditiously.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Protein signaling networks play a key role in cellular function, and their dysregulation is central to many diseases, including cancer. To shed light on signaling network topology in specific contexts, such as cancer, requires interrogation of multiple proteins through time and statistical approaches to make inferences regarding network structure.
RESULTS: In this study, we use dynamic Bayesian networks to make inferences regarding network structure and thereby generate testable hypotheses. We incorporate existing biology using informative network priors, weighted objectively by an empirical Bayes approach, and exploit a connection between variable selection and network inference to enable exact calculation of posterior probabilities of interest. The approach is computationally efficient and essentially free of user-set tuning parameters. Results on data where the true, underlying network is known place the approach favorably relative to existing approaches. We apply these methods to reverse-phase protein array time-course data from a breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-468) to predict signaling links that we independently validate using targeted inhibition. The methods proposed offer a general approach by which to elucidate molecular networks specific to biological context, including, but not limited to, human cancers.

The method presented in this paper, one of the best performing in this challenge, consists of 3 steps: 1. Boolean tables are inferred from single-stimulus/inhibitor data to classify whether a particular combination of stimulus and inhibitor is affecting the protein. 2. A cause-effect network is reconstructed starting from these tables. 3. Training data are linearly combined according to rules inferred from the reconstructed network. This method, although simple, permits one to achieve a good performance providing reasonable predictions based on a reconstructed network compatible with knowledge from the literature. It can be potentially used to predict how signaling pathways are affected by different ligands and how this response is altered by diseases.},

However, such enrichment techniques do not take into account interactions among pathways that are responsible for the IV infection pathogenesis. We investigate dendritic cell response to seasonal H1N1 influenza A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (NC) infection and infer the Boolean logic rules underlying the interaction network of ligand induced signaling pathways and transcription factors. The model reveals several novel regulatory modes and provides insights into mechanism of cross talk between NF$\kappa$B and IRF mediated signaling. Additionally, the logic rule underlying the regulation of IL2 pathway that was predicted by the Boolean model was experimentally validated. Thus, the model developed in this paper integrates pathway analysis tools with the dynamic modeling approaches to reveal the regulation between signaling pathways and transcription factors using genome-wide transcriptional profiles measured upon influenza infection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.
RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings.
CONCLUSION: The WGCNA package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data. The R package along with its source code and additional material are freely available at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA.},

  abstract = {High-throughput experiments are routinely performed in modern biological studies. However, extracting meaningful results from massive experimental data sets is a challenging task for biologists. Projecting data onto pathway and network contexts is a powerful way to unravel patterns embedded in seemingly scattered large data sets and assist knowledge discovery related to cancer and other complex diseases. We have developed a Cytoscape app called ``ReactomeFIViz'', which utilizes a highly reliable gene functional interaction network combined with human curated pathways derived from Reactome and other pathway databases. This app provides a suite of features to assist biologists in performing pathway- and network-based data analysis in a biologically intuitive and user-friendly way. Biologists can use this app to uncover network and pathway patterns related to their studies, search for gene signatures from gene expression data sets, reveal pathways significantly enriched by genes in a list, and integrate multiple genomic data types into a pathway context using probabilistic graphical models. We believe our app will give researchers substantial power to analyze intrinsically noisy high-throughput experimental data to find biologically relevant information.},

  abstract = {The Reactome Knowledgebase (www.reactome.org) provides molecular details of signal transduction, transport, DNA replication, metabolism and other cellular processes as an ordered network of molecular transformations-an extended version of a classic metabolic map, in a single consistent data model. Reactome functions both as an archive of biological processes and as a tool for discovering unexpected functional relationships in data such as gene expression pattern surveys or somatic mutation catalogues from tumour cells. Over the last two years we redeveloped major components of the Reactome web interface to improve usability, responsiveness and data visualization. A new pathway diagram viewer provides a faster, clearer interface and smooth zooming from the entire reaction network to the details of individual reactions. Tool performance for analysis of user datasets has been substantially improved, now generating detailed results for genome-wide expression datasets within seconds. The analysis module can now be accessed through a RESTFul interface, facilitating its inclusion in third party applications. A new overview module allows the visualization of analysis results on a genome-wide Reactome pathway hierarchy using a single screen page. The search interface now provides auto-completion as well as a faceted search to narrow result lists efficiently.},

  doi = {10.3389/fgene.2015.00341},
  abstract = {Tumorigenesis is a multi-step process, involving the acquisition of multiple oncogenic mutations that transform cells, resulting in systemic dysregulation that enables proliferation, invasion, and other cancer hallmarks. The goal of precision medicine is to identify therapeutically-actionable mutations from large-scale omic datasets. However, the multiplicity of oncogenes required for transformation, known as oncogenic collaboration, makes assigning effective treatments difficult. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new type of oncogenic collaboration where mutations in genes that interact with an oncogene may contribute to the oncogene's deleterious potential, a new genomic feature that we term "surrogate oncogenes." Surrogate oncogenes are representatives of these mutated subnetworks that interact with oncogenes. By mapping mutations to a protein-protein interaction network, we determine the significance of the observed distribution using permutation-based methods. For a panel of 38 breast cancer cell lines, we identified a significant number of surrogate oncogenes in known oncogenes such as BRCA1 and ESR1, lending credence to this approach. In addition, using Random Forest Classifiers, we show that these significant surrogate oncogenes predict drug sensitivity for 74 drugs in the breast cancer cell lines with a mean error rate of 30.9\%. Additionally, we show that surrogate oncogenes are predictive of survival in patients. The surrogate oncogene framework incorporates unique or rare mutations from a single sample, and therefore has the potential to integrate patient-unique mutations into drug sensitivity predictions, suggesting a new direction in precision medicine and drug development. Additionally, we show the prevalence of significant surrogate oncogenes in multiple cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas, suggesting that surrogate oncogenes may be a useful genomic feature for guiding pancancer analyses and assigning therapies across many tissue types.},
